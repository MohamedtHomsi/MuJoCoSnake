Assumptions:
1) Geometry is such that the helix blades slide on readily and normal component of weight will be supported by the base drum.
2) Coefficient of friction between screw and ground is constant.
3) Forces acting on helix blade are effectively concentrated at a radius corresponding to the mean height of the blade above the base drum.

Axial Force Balance:
F_cos(α_m - θ) = W (cos(α_m) + μ sin(α_m)) / (cos(θ) - μ sin(θ))

From geometry:
tan(θ) = h / (π * k * D_d)
and
k = h_b / D_d

Where:
h_b = blade height
D_d = drum diameter

Force expression:
F = W (cos(α_m) + μ sin(α_m)) / (cos(θ) - μ sin(θ))

For rolling torque and power to motion (for one screw), we can identify three main energy losses:

a) Drum friction (base of drum on the ground):
P_drum = (μW cos(θ) / sin(θ)) * π * D_d * n_d
where D_d = drum diameter, n_d = RPM

b) Helix blade friction (expressed as normal force at mean height of helix):
P_b = (μF) * π * (d + h_b) * n_h / (cos(θ))

c) Work against gravity and towing:
P_w = W v sin(θ)

Total power:
P_total = P_drum + P_blade + P_w

To non-dimensionalize, divide by Wv and solve:

γ = total power / (Wv)
γ = [A cos(θ) / sin(θ)] * [μ cos(θ) / (1 - μ tan(θ))] + sin(θ)

Let:
P = Tω
ω = 2πn / 60 (rad/s)
n = rev/s

Therefore:
T = (Wv γ) / ω

Units of Force: lb-f
W = weight of 1 screw segment
